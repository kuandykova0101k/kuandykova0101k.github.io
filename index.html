Won the game of TIC-TAC-toe
Players in turn put on the free cells of the field 3x3 signs (one always crosses, the other always noughts). The first player to line up 3 of his pieces vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins. The first move is made by the player putting crosses.

Usually, at the end of the game, the winning side crosses out with a line its three signs (noughts or crosses) that make up a continuous row.
